	  Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
	  by profilers such as OProfile.

	depends on PROFILING && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  No module will be loaded for this.

config VENUS_OPROFILE_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER
	bool "Use performance counter"
	help
	  Use performance counter to profile cache, tlb, branch
	  instructions, ... Mars has this kind of registers, but Venus and
	  Neptune donot.

config VENUS_OPROFILE_CLOCK
	bool "Use Venus CPU clock for oprofile"
	depends on REALTEK_USE_EXTERNAL_TIMER_INTERRUPT
	help
	  Use Venus's CPU clock to drive oprofile, instead of the default
	  scheduler timer interrupt. The CPU clock can drive sampling rate
	  at 2500 (default, changable) per second, compared to 100 sampling
	  per second (fixed) for default timer.

	   Sampling frequency of Oprofile using Venus internal clock.
